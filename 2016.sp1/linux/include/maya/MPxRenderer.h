// CLASS DECLARATION (MPxRenderer)

//! \ingroup OpenMayaRender
//! \brief Base class for plugin renderers
/*!
A base class providing an interface through which a plugin can implement a renderer
to provide rendered images of a scene.

LIMITATION: Currently this class is only used for rendering into the Material Viewer in the Hypershade editor.
For renderer integration into the Render View, please refer to the API class MRenderView and the MEL 
command "renderer". For rendering of shader swatches, please refer to the API class MSwatchRenderBase.

The derived class needs to be registered and deregistered with Maya using calls to 
MFnPlugin::registerRenderer() and MFnPlugin::deregisterRenderer().

Translation of the scene data to render is done by Maya calling the corresponding translate and set methods.
The translate methods (translateMesh(), translateLightSource(), translateCamera(), translateTransform(), translateShader(), translateEnvironment)
should implement translation of a Maya object to a corresponding renderer specific object. 
When Maya calls translate or set methods it is always done in a thread-safe context. This means that the Maya handle
sent in (and associated data) is valid and thread-safe for the duration of the call, but not guaranteed to be 
valid or thread-safe after the call, so the renderer should not save the Maya handle. If it needs to save the 
handle, it should do so using an MObjectHandle and never save the MObject directly. If the handle is saved it is up 
to the renderer to make sure the data is accessed in a thread-safe way.

When Maya translates a shape object (mesh, light, camera), the call to the translate method is always 
followed by one or more calls to translateTransform(), which instantiates the shape and assigns it as a
child to one or more transform nodes.

Calls to all translate and set methods are always preceded by a call to beginSceneUpdate(). This is to let 
the renderer know that scene updates are about to happen, to let it cancel the current rendering or otherwise 
prepare for scene updates. The update is then followed by a call to endSceneUpdate(), to let the renderer know 
that no more updates are comming (until next beginSceneUpdate()). The renderer can then do any scene data 
post-processing and restart the rendering.

Calls to translate and set methods can occur before a render job is started, for initial scene translation. But it 
can also occur during rendering for scene changes. So the renderer must support these methods being called 
at any time. However they are always encapsulated by calls to beginSceneUpdate() and endSceneUpdate().

The translate methods are also used to update already existing objects. So if a translate method is called with an
uuid pointing to an already translated object, that means the object should be updated.

A render session is started by Maya calling startAsync(). This call should start a render control thread running 
asynchronously from Maya's main thread. The control thread is in turn allowed to spawn as many render worker threads 
as given by the JobParams sent in.
	
During rendering the refresh() method should be called to send new image data back to Maya. The progress() method 
could be called to report the progress of the current image.

While the job is running it is up to the renderer to decide when the rendered image is finished. When finished 
the render worker threads should terminate or sleep, and not cause unnecessary CPU usage. If scene updates occur 
the control thread should restart the rendering to produce a new image with the new scene data. The job should be 
running in this manner until a call to stopAsync() is received. At that point both worker threads and the control 
thread should terminate.

A call to destroyScene() should clear out the scene and destroy all allocated scene data.

The steps below outlines the events for a render job session and which calls Maya sends to the renderer. A scene update 
consists of a block of calls, named a Scene Update Block below:

beginSceneUpdate()
	translateMesh()
	translateTransform()
	setProperty()
	setShader()
	...
endSceneUpdate()

1. Maya will start the render session with 0 or more Scene Update Blocks. The renderer should use them to build its internal representation for the scene graph.
2. Maya will call startAsync(). The renderer should start a separate thread.
3. The renderer should start rendering the internal scene graph that it now has, in the separate thread or by starting other worker threads.
4. The renderer should call progress() to indicate to Maya how far along it is. A value between 0.0 and 1.0 indicates the rendering is in progress. A value of 1.0 or higher indicates the rendering is completed. A negative value indicates the task is done and scene graph destroyed (see point 12).
5. The renderer should call refresh() during rendering to present successive image results that Maya can display.
6. When the rendering is completed the renderer should drop into a waiting state. Notification of this is done by calling progress() with a value of 1.0 or higher.
7. Maya may modify the scene graph through additional Scene Update Blocks. If these occur while the renderer is in its waiting state then it must start up a new render. If these occur while the renderer is already rendering, it must incorporate the changes into the current render, typically by restarting it.
8. Steps 3 through 7 may be repeated multiple times.
9. Maya calls stopAsync(). The renderer should terminate its separate threads but retains its internal scene graph.
10. Steps 1 through 9 may be repeated to produce renderings of variations of the same scene.
11. Maya calls destroyScene(). The renderer should destroy its internal scene graph.
12. The renderer should then finish by calling progress() with a negative value, to let Maya know the scene graph is destroyed and the renderer is shut down.
