//! \brief Edits iterator. 
/*!

Use the edits iterator to traverse all the edits on a reference
or assembly. An edit is any operation that modifies the dependency graph
such as modifications to values, connections, parenting and so on. 

In the case of references, edits are the changes that occur to referenced nodes. 
In the case of assemblies, edits are the changes that occur to assembly members.

Edits are returned as either strings representing an equivalent MEL call, or as
a class derived from MEdit. 

The edits iterator works regardless of whether the related reference
or assembly is loaded or unloaded. However, please note that loading
or unloading the related reference or assembly will cause any
in-progress iteration to be reset.

If new edits were created while iterating, the iterator will not necessarily 
traverse them.

To control which edits you will traverse over, use the combination of the 
'editsOwner' and 'targetNode'/'targetNodeName' parameters.

The editsOwner is the reference or assembly node that "owns" edits. This is the 
top-level assembly/reference at the time the edit was made. If you were to save 
a file, this is the node that the edits would be stored on.

The targetNode is the innermost reference or assembly node containing the edited 
nodes. Edits will be physically stored on the edits owner, so use targetNode to
get just edits that affect nodes in a specific assembly/reference. If the nested 
assembly or reference is not loaded, you can still query edits that affect that 
node by specifying a string targetNodeName, instead of a targetNode MObject.

Hierarchical Example:

The following example explains the above terminology in the hierarchical case.
Suppose you have a reference or assembly hierarchy that looks like this.

\verbatim
A
|_ B
   |_ C
\endverbatim

Edits can be made at three different levels:
<ol>
<li> Edits made from C to nodes in C. These edits were made from the C file/assembly.  These edits are stored on C

<li> Edits made from B to nodes in B or C. These edits were made from the B file/assembly.  These edits are stored on B

<li> Edits made from A to nodes in A, B or C. These edits were made from the main scene.  These edits are stored on A
</ol>

To query all the edits stored on A, use:
editsOwner = A
targetNode = MObject::kNullObj

To query edits stored on A that affect nodes in A, use: 
editsOwner = A
targetNode = A

To query edits stored on A that affect nodes in B, use:
editsOwner = A
targetNode = B

To query all the edits stored on B, use:
editsOwner = B
targetNode = MObject::kNullObj

To only query edits stored on B that affect nodes in C, use:
editsOwner = B
targetNode = C
