/*!
  This class is used to register callbacks for scene related messages.

  The addCallback method registers a function that will be executed
  whenever the specified message occurs. An id is returned and is used
  to remove the callback.

  To remove a callback use MMessage::removeCallback.  All callbacks
  that are registered by a plug-in must be removed by that plug-in
  when it is unloaded. Failure to do so will result in a fatal error.
